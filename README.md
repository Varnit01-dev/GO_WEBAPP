DevOps Portfolio

Overview

This portfolio showcases my skills in DevOps by demonstrating a basic static website deployment using various DevOps tools and technologies.

Technologies Used

- Containerization: Multi-Stage Docker Build
- Orchestration: Kubernetes Manifests
- Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions
- Continuous Delivery: Argo CD
- Kubernetes Cluster creation and setup
- Helm chart creation and configuration for multiple environments
- Ingress controller creation and configuration to expose application
- DNS mapping for our domain

Project Structure

- docker/: Dockerfile and multi-stage build configuration
- kubernetes/: Kubernetes manifests for deployment, service, and ingress
- .github/workflows/: GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- argo/: Argo CD configuration for continuous delivery
- helm/: Helm chart for deploying application to multiple environments

CI/CD Pipeline

1. GitHub Actions builds and pushes Docker image to registry
2. Argo CD deploys application to Kubernetes cluster
3. Helm chart configures application for multiple environments
4. Ingress controller exposes application to external traffic
5. DNS mapping routes traffic to our domain

Demonstration

This portfolio demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for deploying a basic static website using DevOps tools and technologies.

Conclusion

This portfolio showcases my skills in DevOps by demonstrating a basic static website deployment using various DevOps tools and technologies. It highlights my ability to design and implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Argo CD, and Kubernetes.
